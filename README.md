Spotify Top Hits Analysis

In this data science project "Spotify Top Hits Analysis," I harnessed the power of Spotify's rich dataset, which contains an array of song qualities like energy, key, loudness, and tempo.
The project's objective was to develop a predictive model that could determine whether a song would become a top hit or not based on these musical attributes. 
After meticulous data preparation, I established the key and energy variables as independent factors and defined the top half of hits as the dependent variable. 
The dataset was then thoughtfully split into training and testing sets, enabling the model to learn and generalize. 
With hyperparameter tuning and model initialization, I achieved an optimal predictive performance. 
By visually representing the decision boundary, I shed light on the model's decision-making process. 
Results were presented, showcasing how the model could predict song success for different key and energy combinations.
Furthermore, hyperparameter tuning yielded refinements, reinforcing the model's adaptability and potential in the realm of music analysis. 

Outcome: This project underscores the transformative impact of data science and machine learning on the music industry, 
providing valuable insights for aspiring musicians and industry professionals.
